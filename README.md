# 👁️ Eye Blink Detection Model

A lightweight and effective eye blink detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and mediapipe. This project detects eye blinks in real-time from video streams.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses mediapipe's facial landmark tool to collect regions of eyes.
- Predicts with pretrained model whether and eye is open or closed.
- Shows outputs such as: number of blinks, total time of closed eyes and average time per blink
